# A-Guide-To-The-K-means-Clustering-Algorithm-ParkerGibbons

This repository contains the annotated code for the k-means clustering algorithm using the baseball guiding example. The code is annotated and can be used as a template. The MLB data used for the example is also provided as a csv file. 

Abstract:
Data in the real-world could be presented with natural groupings and patterns that are not immediately obvious. Thus we need a method for working with unlabeled, unclassified data (unsupervised learning). There is also the chance that datasets could be higher dimensional with multiple features, which could be difficult to directly interpret. As a result, the method also needs to be able to reduce the dimension of the data or observation space. Moreover, the method needs to be appropriate to a wide range of applications where unsupervised learning is required to identify natural groupings or patterns within data.
